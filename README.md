My Personal Website
---------------

This website is a rails application that is basically a dumping ground for any software project that I want to try out. The majority of it is for learning some front end styling.

There are a few main features as of now.

### Homepage ###

>The [homepage] features parallax scrolling and a picture slideshow

### Review ###

>The [review page] is to be updated for each biannual review, or a new page will be made for each additional review. This has not been decided as of yet.

### Transactions ###

>The goal of the [transactions page] is to keep track of investment value over time. Currently, it allows users to input a stock transaction to see how that investment is doing now. It accounts for the money you have previously made in order to get an accurate measure of how much money you have gained (YAY) or lost (boo...). Users can also input their transactions into a csv file to be uploaded and automatically turned into a series of transactions. Eventually it will graph these values to show how successful you have been over time.
>The CSV input needs to be in the format 'symbol,action,quantity,price,date(yyyy-mm-dd)' like:

     GE,buy,10,21.5,2012-10-25

### Pictures ###

> The [pictures page] is a spot to show pictures I have taken from the different places I have been.

>Current limitations:

- There are no user accounts, so once a transaction is uploaded it is there for all users to see.
- The styling of the page is not the most user friendly.


*This is an ongoing project that will be added to over time.
